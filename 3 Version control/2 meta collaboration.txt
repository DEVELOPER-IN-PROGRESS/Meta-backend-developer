meta uses one giant monolithic repository for backend code whereas in other company
each team has their own code called microservices .
bacause meta uses one repository merge conflict happens a lot so smaller changes are done each
time . Also  they add lots of gatekeepers so they don't need to wait for rollback

" git blame "

CREATE DATABASE  <DB NAME>;
ONCE db is created we need to create tables which can be performed by
CREATE TABLE <table name> ; command or
CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name1 datatype(size), column_name2 datatype(size), column_name3 datatype(size));
Data population is done by DML which is

INSERT INTO <table name> ( col1 , col2 ...) VALUES (value1 , value2 ....) ;
UPDATE <tablename> SET <col> = value WHERE ID  = val ;
Deleta a table --  DROP TABLE table_name;

1. Syntax to add a column into a table:
 ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (column_name datatype(size));
2. Syntax to add a primary key to a table:
 ALTER TABLE table_name ADD primary key (column_name);

to delete all records from a table - TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

Comments in SQL  --
eg --Retrieve all data from a table


Transaction Control Language (TCL)
The TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database.
These are used to manage the changes made to the data in a table by utilizing the DML commands.

COMMIT Command to save all the work you have already done in the database.
ROLLBACK Command to restore a database to the last committed state.

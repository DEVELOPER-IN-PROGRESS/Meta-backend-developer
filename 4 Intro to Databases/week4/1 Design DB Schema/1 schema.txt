a Schema is how data is arranged in Database
Before anyone can insert data a db schema must be defined , which can also be considered as a blueprint of data.
the process of schema design is called as data modelling.


Database schema can be broadly divided into three categories.
    1)  Conceptual or logical schema that defines entities, attributes and relationships.

    2)  Internal or physical schema that defines how data is stored in a secondary storage. In other words, the actual storage of data and access paths.

    3)  External or view schema that defines different user views.

Programming with python
Week 2 (Functions)

Variable scope
Local < Enclosing < Global <  Built-in scope
(LEGB)
local scope is scope of variables inside a function

enclosing scope refers to nested functions . the innermost block can access outermost scopes and
not vice versa

global scope refers to variables decalared outside functions

Builtin scope refers to reserved keywords that python use for builtin functions .
these can be accessed from any levels

list methods
insert
append
extend
pop(index)
del

Tuple methods
index(value to be searched)

Set methods
union(set) or  set A | set B
intersection(set)   or set A & set B

setA.difference(set B)  return only element that are present in A
or set A - set B

set.symmetric_difference(set) return the unique elements present in both set
set A^ set B

set is not a sequence

kwargs
when we want  to pass any amount of keyword arguments to a function
using **agrs we can pass any number of non keyword arguments

try :

except Exceptions as e:
	print(e)
	print(e.__class__)


Everything in python is an object or derived from object class

class dummy :
	pass
here pass refers to no statements so it dosen't return error


class A:
	r = 10


var A1 = A()
A1.r  #returns 10

A.r = 20

changing the class attributes directly would affect the instance  values created from it

super.__init__(**kwargs)  initializes base classes inside the child class

Abstract Classes::  in Abstract class you can ensure functionality of every class that is derived
from it . The methods we put in abstract class are guarenteed to be present in derived class
You cannot create instance for abstract class and python does not support abstraction directly
from abc import ABC (abstract module)


Method Resolution Order Determines which is derived from which
Default order in python is from bottom to top left to right
usage = class.mro()


Reloads module
make dynamic changes within code to make import statements
Usage:
import importlib
import <filename>

importlib.reload(filename)



Testing types
Unit test , Integration Test , System Test , Acceptance tests
White box Testing - Tester has knowledge about code implementation , architecture , system design
Black box Testing - vice versa


Pytest - python unit Testing library

When a Django project is created with the **startproject** command, it creates a container folder. Django puts a manage.py script and the project package folder in the outer folder.

Let's briefly explain the Python scriptscreated in the project folder

#### views.py
In Django, a view is a user-defined function that’s called when Django’s URL dispatcher identifies the client’s request URL and matches it with a URL pattern defined in the urls.py file.

#### urls.py
The project package has a file of this name that defines the URL patterns for the project.

#### models.py
The data models required for processing in this app are created in this file. It is empty by default. A data model is a Python class based on django.db.modelsclass.All the models present here are migrated to the database tables. For now, leave his file as it is without adding any models. You will learn how to work with models later.


#### tests.py
You’ll write the tests to be run on the app in this file.

#### Creating an App
run `python -m django startapp <app_name> <location>`
if location is omitted then the app will be created in the project root location
